# MLX-graphs

MLX-graphs is a library for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) built upon Apple's MLX.

### Work in progress üöß

We just started the development of this lib, with the aim to integrate it within [mx-explore](https://github.com/ml-explore).

The lib follows the Message Passing Neural Network ([MPNN](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/gilmer17a/gilmer17a.pdf)) architecture to build arbitrary GNNs on top of it, similarly as in [PyG](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric). 

### Why running GNNs on my Mac?

By leveraging Apple Silicon, running GNNs enjoys accelerated GPU computation ‚ö°Ô∏è and unified memory architecture. This eliminates device data transfers and enables leveraging all available memory to store large graphs directly on your Mac's GPU.

### Why contributing?

We are at an early stage of the development of the lib, which means your contributions can have a large impact!
Everyone is welcome to contribute, just open an issue üìù with your idea üí° and we'll work together on the implementation ‚ú®.
